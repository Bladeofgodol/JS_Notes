### variables
* variables hold values just like in math
* case sensetive
* we use = to assign values and == to compare variablse if they are equal to each other
* 4 ways to declare a variable
    * ```js
      var w = 1;
      let x = 2; 
      const y = 4; //y is always constantly 4 we cant re declare variables first declared by let or const
      z = 5;
      ```
    * `let` is a newer but simmilar way to diclare like `var`
